# mail-import-for-csv
a tool that for now i will still support but maybe it is not needed, the allow any user to save to a file some mail addresses and you can after convert to cvs for create an easy to use mail list.
If anyone want can improve  the tool (written in C++) or download and use for personal o commercial purposes.
